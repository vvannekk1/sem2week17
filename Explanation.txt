For this lab, I checked the site for accessibility issues and fixed a few important ones.
 First, some form fields didn’t have proper labels, which makes it hard for screen reader users to understand what each input is for.
I added correct labels so all fields are clearly identified and easier to use.

 Second, the skip-to-content link didn’t work properly for keyboard users because the main section couldn’t receive focus. I fixed this by making the main area focusable, so users can skip navigation and go straight to the content.

I also improved the timetable by replacing hidden symbols with text like “No class,” so screen readers can read it correctly.

These changes make the site easier to navigate, more accessible, and more user-friendly overall.
